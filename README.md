# qa - quality assurance 7T fMRI data

## what data?

this is not supposed to replace the detailed, technical QA that will routinely be run at the MR centre, but will hopefully provide a

## PSIR

provides the files / example for calculating PSIR images on the console. we'll use this as a starting point for getting the code in ``fmriQA`` to run / do the right thing.

##Â how to run?

- on PRIDE / the Philips scanner
- straight from ``matlab``
- in shell wrapper


## desiderata

We may also want to be able to run this in one of the following ways:

```matlab
  uonQA() % allow data file picking.
  uonQA('test_data_set01.nii') % NIFTI-1
  uonQA('test_data_set01.img') % NIFTI_PAIR
```

Wrapped in a shell script? If ``matlab`` is available from command line:

```bash
matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -r "run /location/on/machine/uonQA.m"
```
( See e.g. http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/29716-running-matlab-script-through-unix-bash-script )

We want the the program to output some basic info on
  - tSNR - voxel-wise temporal SNR \frac{\mu_t}{\sigma_t}
  - auto-picked ROI, given size, # of voxels?
